# Running on the local development server:

First clone the repository, cd into the web-project folder and run npm start
to open the local development server on your machine.

# TODO:

 - Create styling elements to make the page more appealing, what is currently on the page now is NOT permanent.
 - Format the forms so that they interact with the database, also make it so that there is a printable version of what         information is retrieved from the query.
 - Implement a prompt that has the user change language to whichever preference they choose. 
 - Styling, styling and more styling to make everything simple for non-native english speakers to read and comprehend, perhaps review accessability.


# Ideas:

 - I think that the easiest way to implement a separate printable page for the information entered would be to be to remotely query the database and store that information in a JSON file that can be read and placed in a template that can be printed out. Maybe look into this for the future?
